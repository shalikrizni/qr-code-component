## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is my seconds HTML & CSS Challenge and  It was quite easy than I expected, I made really good progress I was able to complete 80% of the code within 30 minutes, and I had to invest some time to go again and watch some tutorials to gain some knowledge about responsiveness

### Continued development

I am planning to use CSS custom variables, as well as other styling techniques such as CSS flexbox and grid, to approach and solve problems in my future projects and challenges. These techniques will allow me to design websites more efficiently and creatively.

Overall, I am confident that by employing these techniques and methodologies, I will be able to approach web development with a more structured and efficient mindset, leading to better and more innovative designs.
